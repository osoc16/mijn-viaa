                    <p>Open Knowledge Belgium is a non-profit whose main goal is to stimulate Open Knowledge in Belgium.</p>

                    <p>
                        This happens through different activities, one being Open Belgium.
                        It's a platform which provides a voice to everyone involved in open efforts in Belgium.
                        Opening up Belgian knowledge is not a task limited to governments or data owners, it’s something we all can support and cultivate.
